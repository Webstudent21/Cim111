   <p>Both Operating systems have there Pro's and Con's But if i had to declare a winner it would be android.i choose android as the winner because
     it caters to more people's needs in terms both hardware and software options.On the hardware side you have way more phones to choose from at
     different price ranges so more people can find a phone that meets there needs in terms of budget,features etc.On the Software side android has
     a more diverse selection of applications so technologically astute indiviuals may find android more appealing and there are more apps on android
     that address niche use cases like notification logs for example.This is why Android is the winner.</p>
