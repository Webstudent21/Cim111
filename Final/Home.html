    <h1>Android vs Ios</h1>

    <p> This website was created to compare and contrast the two most dominant mobile operating systems Android and Ios.I will
      discuss the differences between the two platforms,the advantages of each operating system and then I will come to a conclusion
      and decide which platform is #1.</p>
    <section id="grid1">
    <h2>Ios</h2>

    <h3>Pros</h3>

      <img src="https://image.businessinsider.com/5d84e8b12e22af575202ae42?width=1100&format=jpeg&auto=webp" alt="Ios" Width="800" Height="500" class="center">

    <p><b>Consistent experience and less confusion</b>-When you buy an IPhone you know exactly what your getting because ios is a close source os that can only be used by apple.So there are handful of iphones made by one company
      and there is no confusion on which phone to buy.This is very different from the android platform which is much more fragmented.There are 1000's of different android devices on the market that run different versions
      of android and the manafacturer can also modify the os as well by creating their own skin(ex.Miui,One ui,Oxygen os etc.)This creates more confusion and less consistency on the platform.</p>

    <p><b>Software updates</b>-When you buy an a new iphone you are pretty much guarenteed 5 years of software updates.If you buy an android device the support you recieve can vary greatly when going from one device to another.If you buy
      a cheap phone from an unpopular brand you may not recieve any support at all but if you buy a more expensive phone from a well established brand like the google pixel then you will recieve a few years of software updates.</p>

    <p><b>Resale Value</b>-IPhones tend to hold on to there value much better than Android devices.So if you get a new Iphone the resale value will depreciate much slower than if you buy a new android device</p>

    <h3>Cons</h3>

    <p><b>Expensive</b>-The cheapest Iphone apple sells currently is the iphone 8 for 450$.There are android phones that you can buy for under 100$ dollars</p>

    <p><b>Lack of hardware Choice</b>-There are only a handful of different Iphone models to choose from and there are very few differences between them.There are 1000's of Android
      devices on the market to choose from with many differences</p>

    <p><b>Lack of innovation</b>-Since there is only one company makes phones running ios there is no competiton on the ios platform and these leads to a lack of innovation.</p>

     <h2>Android</h2>

     <h3>Pros</h3>

          <img src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/androidphones-2x1-.jpg" alt="android" Width="800" Height="400" class="center">

     <p><b>Affordability</b>-You can purchase a functional smartphone running android for significantly less than the cheapest Iphone apple sells.This is the
       reason why Android is the dominant platform in developing countries where most people simply can't afford to buy an IPhone.</p>

     <p><b>More hardware choices</b>-You can purchase an android phone with a micro sd card slot,no micro sd card slot,a really big screen or very small screen,a headphone jack or no headphone jack,bezless screen etc.
       The point im trying to make is that on android you have way more options so your more likely to find a phone that meets your criteria for what you want in a phone.The IPhone only gives you handful of
       options and if you don't like these options that is too bad.</p>

    <p><b>More innovation and faster technological advancement</b>-One great charesteristic of the android platform is the high level of competition on the platform.There many different phone manufacturers that
    Create android phones this means that to stand out from the crowd android phone manafacturer have to be more innovative to compete.This is why we general see new and intresting concepts on the android platform
    first like foldable phones,in display fingerprint scanners,higher refresh rate screens etc.Another benefit of the android platform is quicker technological advancements due to new phones being released every year.For example
    there are already android phones that are 5g capable while even the latest Iphone is not 5g capable.Also nfc payments(google wallet)was available on android years before it came to ios.</p>

    <h3>Cons</h3>

        <img src="https://news-cdn.softpedia.com/images/news2/check-out-the-true-face-of-android-fragmentation-488588-2.jpg" alt="android" Width="800" Height="400" class="center">

    <p><b>Inconsistent experience</b>-Since android is an open source os the experience going from one android phone to another can be drastically different.Some phones have
      certain software features that others don't because of the modifications made to the os by the manafacturer.Many phones run different versions of the operating system as Well
      and the menu and even the way the software works can be different between different android devices.Ios is a much more uniform and consistent platform compared to android</p>

   <p><b>Software updates</b>-The android platform as whole is not very good at delivering software updates compared to ios.The majority of android users actually run older version of
     android on there phone.There are phones you can get like the pixel that will give you good software support but the majority of android devices barely recieve any software updates.
     This is one area where ios dominates.</p>

     <p><b>Resale value</b>-If you buy even a flagship android device the market value will depreciate much quicker than an iphone.One artice from buisnessinsider stated that Iphones typically hold 15% more
       value compared to android phones after a year.This is a significant difference,and it is another advantage of using an iphone over android device.</p>
