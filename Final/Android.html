    <h1>5 Reasons why Android is better than ios</h1>

        <section id="grid1">
       <h2>Customization</h2>

        <p>Ios has very limited customization options because apple doesn't want to allow users to change the way ios looks or functions
        On ios your allowed to Rearrange apps within the app grid,create folders,change the wallpaper,the keyboard and add and remove
        shortcuts from the control panel.On Android you can do all of this and much more you can set default applications,you can add
        widgets to the homescreen,install third party launchers with additional functionality and customization options.You can even
        go into the developer options and change animation speeds for transitions.Customization is not only great for creating an aesthetically
        pleasing layout it can also increase convenience and improve the user experience.For example since  android users are allowed to put widgets directly
        on their homescreen you can put a direct dial widget for a contact right on your homescreen to make calling that person a simple one step process.
        You can set default apps so the os will default to that application when you are trying to perform an action that is compatible with the application.
        For example you can have websites open in firefox everytime you tap a link on android but on ios when you tap a link to a website it wil always
        open in safari and there is no way to change this.These are just two examples but there are many ways customization can be beneficial to users.</p>

        <h2>Multitasking</h2>

        <p>Apps on ios are allowed to run a few processes like audio,gps,voip etc. in the background for an indefinite amount of time but other processes like downloading and uploading are only allowed to run for a limited amount of time and there is no splitscreen or pip on ios.On android apps are
          allowed to run a service in the "background" indefinetly as long as there is a persistent notification so that the user knows the app is still running.This gives android users an advantage in certain use cases.For example downloading multiple hd movies in queque or using
          true automation apps that must run in the background constantly like tasker.Inaddition to this stock Android has also had splitscreen multitasking since version 7.0 and native pip support since version 8.0.So if you want to have two applications open at once or play a video in a
          minimized window you can do that on android.Overall the multitasking capabilities of android are superior to ios</p>

        <h2>File Management</h2>

        <img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/08/01-android-file-managers-100734197-large.jpg" alt="customization" width="600" height="500" class="center">

        <p> Seamless file management is Another advantage Android has over ios.To understand what im talking about I will have to explain the difference between file management on ios and android.
          On ios apps have sandboxed file access which means they are only allowed to access the files they create or files that are in there own dedicated folder.On android apps can access a central
          file system and they can read and write to those files.Now you might be wondering how is android's system of file management advantageous?Well to help you understand I will give you an example.
          Let's say you want to download a third party video player to watch videos because you don't like the default video player.So you would expect that you should be able to easily access those videos right
          from within the video player app right?Well this is not how it works on ios since apps can't access files that aren't in there own folder you have to indivually export videos from the ios file manager to
          vlc and then organize them as well this makes the user experience more cubersome and creates unnecessary duplicates that take up more storage.By contrast doing the same thing on android is as easy as
          opening the video player app and granting it access to your files after you do this all the videos on your phone will not only be accessible through that video player but they will also be organized the same way
           there organized in your file manager.This just one example but there are many instances where android system of file management is advantageous.</p>

        <h2>More diverse app selection/sideloading</h2>

         <img src="https://www.gizrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Top-5-Google-Play-Store-Alternatives.jpg" alt="customization" width="600" height="400" class="center">

        <p>Ios is know for being a secure operating system but this comes at a cost.Ios in general is more restrictive than android and this is apparent when you look at the variety of apps available on both appstores.
          Apple is more selective when it comes to what apps they allow into the appstore and Ios apps have less permissions than Android apps this results in a less diverse selection of applications available on the Ios
          appstore compared to the google playstore.Here are some examples of applications that are only available on the google playstore</p>

          <ul>
          <li>Emulators-There are many console emulators on android from nes all the way up to wii(dolphin) emulators are not allowed on the ios appstore</li>
          <li>Torrent downloaders-There many torrent downloaders availabe on android to allow you to download torrents but there are none on ios </li>
          <li>Floating apps-Apps that overlay on top of your screen some examples are directchat,fooview, and flynx Ios lacks the necessary permissions these apps rely on.</li>
          <li>App cloner-There are apps on android that allow you to clone an app on your phone and run two account simulatenously some examples are Parallel spaces,and Dual space.</li>
          <li>Servers-There are applicaions on android that will allow you to run a server on your phone a popular one is Servers ultimate these apps are not allowed on ios</li>
         </ul>
        <p>Those are just some examples but there are even more types of applications that can only be found on the google playstore.Another major advantage to using android is the ability
          for users to sideload applications.This means you are not limited to installing apps on the playstore.You can install apps on the third party appstores like f-droid which only
          has open source applications or any other source wheter that be on the internet,an apk file that was sent to you via email,bluetooth telegram etc.You are allowed to install
          whatever apps you want even apps google doesn't approve of.For example google does not allow applications on the google playstore that interfere with other applications displaying
          ads so there are no system wide add blockers on the playstore.However you can get around this restriction easily by sideloading an application called blockada which does block ad system
          wide.You can also even install older version of applications in case the new update had bug or you simply don't like it.On Ios this is not the case you as a user are only allowed to install
          the applications that apple allows you to install.Sideloading is banned on ios so if you even attempt to sideload an application on ios it will get revoked in a short period of time.</p>

        <h2>Openess and Interoperability</h2>

                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjVoV9B8lunSyGEr9E0RWrRl-_A=/1400x1050/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19270920/microsoftyourphonecalls.jpg" alt="customization" width="600" height="400" class="center">

        <p>Many tech channels on youtube will talk about the seamless integration you get with apple's ecosystem and how great it is.What they won't mention is how closed the ecosystem is as well.The apple
          ecosystem works great but you are limited to only using apple products.However Android devices are much better at intergating with other devices for example there are more desktop integration apps
          available on android compared to ios.Some examples are yourphone,kde connect,and join these apps are great desktop integration apps that work with windows,linux and other operating systems.These apps
          are not available on ios and the few desktop integration apps that are available on ios like pushbullet have limited functionality compared to the android version.Android also has no strict standards
          for controllers but on ios controllers must meet the mfi(made for Iphone) standard.Pretty much any bluetooth controller will work with android but only controllers that meet the mfi standard wil work
          with ios this means android users you have a wider selection of controllers to choose from that are also cheaper as well.Another example of android being more open is support for universal interfaces and protcols
          like bluetooth file transfer,usb type c,usb otg etc.The ios/Iphone equivalents of these things are propiertary ex.Airdrop,lightning cable.Overall android gives the user way more flexibity when it comes to which
          device they want to integrate with.</p>
