    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>on ios apps go through a stringent vetting process before they are allowed into the appstore to ensure that these apps are not malicious and that they follow apples
      guidelines.In addition to this apple has pretty strict policies when it comes to what is allowed on the appstore.It can take weeks for apple to allow an application
      on the ios appstore but an application can be on the playstore in a few hours.As a result users are less likely to install malicious applications on the ios appstore compared to
       the playstore.Ios also doesn't give users the ability to sideload application which is another way users can potentially install bad applications.Overall Ios is more secure compared
       to android.Malicious apps still do get into the appstore but this happens less frequently compared to the google playstore.</p>

    <h2>Apps come first on Ios</h2>

    <p>Android and Ios are the two dominant mobile operating systems right now so if a major application from a big company is realeased 99.9% of the time it will be available on both
      platforms.However in some cases Major apps come to ios a few months earlier than android.Some example are Fornite,Super Mario run and the ps4 remote play app.Most apps
      are launched on both plaforms at the same time but there are still some instances where an app will be available on ios months before it comes to Android.</p>

    <p>Another nice advantage you get when using ios is the apple apps and features that are exclusive to ios like Imessage,Airdrop,etc.With Imessage for example you get an enhanced text messaging experience
    So you can do things that simply aren't possible with standard sms text messaging on android.Like sending larger files,money,sending messages over wifi,etc. and you also get end to end encyrption
    for better privacy.While you can get third party messaging apps on android like telegram that give you similar benefits the main advantage of imessage is that it comes preinstalled on the Iphone.Airdrop
    allows to transfer files to other apple devices at a much faster speed than using bluetooth file transfer.You can also send files to a large group of people at the same time as long as they have Airdrop toggled on.</p>

    <p>If you own a an ios device and other apple products,A mac,Ipad,and Apple watch.All these devices will have good integration right out of the box there is no need to configure anything.Here are some examples
      of things you can do when you are using the apple ecosystem.

      <ul>
        <li>Send and recieve text messages on all your devices</li>
        <li>Make and answer calls on all your devices</li>
        <li>Handoff-Start something in one application on one device and continue on another</li>
        <li>Airdrop-easily send large files to your other devices with airdrop</li>
        <li>Universal clipboard-Copy and paste content from one apple device to another</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The seamless integration you get with the apple ecosystem is something that would be hard to replicate with other device.</p>
